## Field of study: 
Unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code. Software testing helps ensure code quality,
and it's an integral part of software development. It's a software development best practice to write software as small, functional
units then write a unit test for each code unit. You can first write unit tests as code. Then, run that test code automatically every 
time you make changes in the software code. This way, if a test fails, you can quickly isolate the area of the code that has the bug or 
error. Unit testing enforces modular thinking paradigms and improves test coverage and quality. Automated unit testing helps ensure you
or your developers have more time to concentrate on coding.
